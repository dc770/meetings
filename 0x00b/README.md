## Speaker - none
## Lock Picking Workshop
### We will have a number of lock pick sets and practice locks including (I believe) some standard locks, clear 'training' locks and cylinder locks (like from vending machines).  There was also some discussion of having a presentation on re-keying locks.  
## Likely Discussion
### Potential meet-up between DC770 and DC404 at DC25
### Potential to 'sponsor' a new DEF CON group in Anchorage, AK (DC907)
#### I have no idea what 'sponsorship' would mean at this time but hope to hash that out at the meeting
